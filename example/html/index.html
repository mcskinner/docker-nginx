<h1>Welcome to an alternative configuration of nginx in Docker!</h1>
<p>If you see this page, then not only is the nginx web server successfully installed,
you've also managed to supply some of the further configuration that is required!

<p>This is just a sample though, so you still have more configuration to do.</p>

<p>Remember, there is always more configuration to do.</p>

<p>For configuration starters, head back to the source at
<a href="https://github.com/mcskinner/docker-nginx">github.com/mcskinner/docker-nginx</a>.</p>

<p>For nginx online documentation and support please refer to
<a href="http://nginx.org/">nginx.org</a>.</p>

<p><em>Thank you for using nginx in Docker.</em></p>
